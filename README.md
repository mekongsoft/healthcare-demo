We enhanced our automatic disease predictions to 12 diseases while current software systems only have around 6 diseases, so now we can predict the most diseases in comparison to other same-kind software around North America.

We now have launched Covid-19, Skin Cancer and Tuberculosis, in which Skin Cancer now includes 7 types: Actinic Keratoses, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Benign Keratosis-like Lesions, Dermatofibroma, Melanoma, Melanocytic Nevi and Vascular Lesions.

So if you are interested in researching our newest medical diagnosis system that is currently open for trial usage with $1 dollar trial price. So now we are 

I) Autistic Spectrum Disorder of Prediction Accuracy: 97%

II) Breast Accuracy: 98%

III) Covid-19: 97.1%

IV) Diabetes: 86%

V) DNA Genetic Disorder: 96%

VI) Heart Disease: 90%

VII) Kidney Disease: 98%

VIII) Liver Disease: 84%

IX) Pneumonia: 94%

X) Skin Cancer: 81%

XI) Stroke: 81%, and

XII) Tuberculosis: 98%

We have new research on Medical Machine Learning to find precious clients who are interested in our Automatic Medical Diagnosis software online, 

Go ahead, medical software is an important part of Canadian hospitals and Medical schools. So why not try our solution ?
